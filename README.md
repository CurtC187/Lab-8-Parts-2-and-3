 - My game idea is a traffic style racing 
game where the player would have to avoid 
oncoming cars to get to the end.

- The player model would be that of a car and the
"enemies" would be different cars coming at you and
it is set on a street road background.

- The player's goal is to get through the 
different stages of cars to get to the end 
and the player can move in 2 dimensionals.  

- The game win condition is when you have passed a 
certain number of cars and the lose condition is when 
you come into contact with a car.

- The cars will become faster as you progress making
them harder to hit.

- My source of inspiration comes from a game called Traffic Racer
which is similar but more complicated.

- Someone who is capable with working in a team and can help
in the making of the game.
